### Greetings, comrades 👋 I am Kseniia, and I am a web developer 👩‍💻

## About me
I'm Kseniia, a web developer with a mission to make the digital world a better place, one code snippet at a time. Originally from the charming city of Saint-Petersburg, Russia, I eventually discovered my second home in Japan, where I spent 6.5 amazing years before taking the plunge into the exciting world of web development in the US.

Now, here's the real fun part - I'm fluent in JavaScript, English, Japanese, and Russian. Yep, you heard that right! I can communicate with machines and humans alike. Although I must admit, deciphering cat 🐈 language seems to be a tougher nut to crack than coding!

When I'm not busy crafting code, you can find me diving into the captivating universe of movies, TV shows, anime, and of course, cat videos. My feline friends are always there, judging my taste in entertainment.

Open communication and teamwork are my guiding stars, both in life and work. Embracing diversity and different perspectives adds a splash of excitement to everything. 
So, if you're in search of a dedicated web developer who can speak the languages of both machines and humans, let's team up and create something amazing together!
